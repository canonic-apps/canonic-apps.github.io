    <h1>CANONIC: A Framework for Declarative Governance</h1>
    <p class="meta">Whitepaper v1.0 | 2026</p>
    
    <div class="abstract">
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> We present CANONIC, a governance framework where rules are expressed as declarative specifications validated through a directed acyclic graph (DAG). CANONIC enables recursive validation across organizational boundaries using a 7-bit dimensional model (DETROSP) supporting 128 distinct governance compositions.
    </div>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Traditional governance systems fail at scale because rules are ambiguous, enforcement is manual, and compliance is retrospective. CANONIC inverts this model: governance is declarative, validation is automated, and compliance is continuous.</p>
    
    <h2>2. The DETROSP Model</h2>
    <p>Each governance dimension is a bit. Organizations select their composition: from minimal (D∩S = 33) to full (DETROSP = 127).</p>
    
    <h2>3. BYOL: Universal Language Support</h2>
    <p>CANONIC is language-agnostic. LANGUAGE/MACHINE/ governs code. LANGUAGE/HUMAN/ governs natural language specifications. RFC 2119 keywords are internationalized.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>CANONIC demonstrates that governance can be both rigorous and practical through declarative specifications, automated validation, and universal language support.</p>
